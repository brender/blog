  <h1>About Brenda</h1>
  <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Brenda McIntosh. After starting my career at Boeing, I left to pursue my interest in web design and development. I'm happily learning and creating each day. You can learn more about my work <a href="http://brendamcintosh.com" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
  <p>I created All the Things from scratch as a means to learn Ruby on Rails and enhance my web development skills. It has become a creative outlet and a place to share all the things that I love</p>
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
